# Software testing fundamentals 
⚙️
- [⏫ Back to Top Page ⏫](#The-Software-Testing-Router)

Before you can start testing software, you need to understand the terminology, the logic reason of when to do what and the why.
i suggest of corse to learn ISTQB FOUNDATION as a ground base of knowladge required to start your path from.
there is also a need to understand testing methologies such as Agile and SCRUM framework which is the main domain of performing test nowdays.
here are main objectives a QA tester need to understand and apply, the more deeper the understanding will go, the smarter the QA tester will be, the more proffesional skills and confidence he will add to the project under test.

The QA tester has main responsebility, to give confidence in the stability of the software to performe as the client expect it be.
we need to thibk on every scenario, every test case, we need to challenge the software in the most creative possible way our time and budgest allow in order to alert on every defect we can find to raise the confidence rate before the software goes production.

| Quality Assurance | Activities focused on providing confidence that quality requirements will be fulfilled|
|Testing|The process consisting of all lifecycle activities, both static and dynamic, concerned with planning, preparation and evaluation of a component or system and related work products to determine that they satisfy specified requirements, to demonstrate that they are fit for purpose and to detect defects|
|Defect|An imperfection or deficiency in a work product where it does not meet its requirements or specifications|
|Bug| a failure or a flaw in the software program|
|Failure|An event in which a component or system does not perform a required function within specified limits|
|Error / Mistake|A human action that produces an incorrect result|

# Testing Types 
🎯
- [⏫ Back to Top Page ⏫](#The-Software-Testing-Router)

Theres many testing types and techniques, each one is suited for a different need in the SDLC, most of them can be automated(will be discussed later in this repo) and some are are avalable only when using third-party tools and scripting language.

Here are testing types and techniques a tester must understand and apply when scenario require:

### Testing Levels and approach:

| Test name  | Used for      | Learn more |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| `Unit testing`   | a software testing method by which individual units of source code being tested  | [Unit testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing) |
| `Component testing`  | done after unit testing, testing component without integrating with other components e.g. modules, classes, objects, and programs |[Component testing](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/definition/component-testing) |
| `Integration testing` |Testing group of units that suppose to work together and being connected as one unit of action| [Integration testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integration_testing)|
|`System testing`|a complete integrated system test to evaluate the system's compliance with its specified requirements|[System testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_testing)|
|`Acceptance testing`| a test conducted to determine if the requirements of a specification or contract are met|[Acceptance testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceptance_testing) |

### Testing techniques and tactics:
| Test name  | Used for      | 
| ------------- | ------------- |
|End to end testing|AKA E2E testing, A type of testing in which business processes are tested from start to finish under production-like circumstances|
|API testing|Testing performed by submitting requests to the test object using its application programming interface|
|Alpha testing| A type of acceptance testing performed in the developer's test environment by roles outside the development organization|
|Beta testing|A type of acceptance testing performed at an external site to the developer's test environment by roles outside the development organization|
|Production acceptance testing|A type of acceptance testing performed to determine if operations and/or systems administration staff can accept a system.|
|Smoke / Confidence test|A test suite that covers the main functionality of a component or system to determine whether it works properly before planned testing begins|
|Sanity/ Check test|a basic test to quickly evaluate whether a claim or the result of a calculation can possibly be true|
|Regression testing|A type of change-related testing to detect whether defects have been introduced or uncovered in unchanged areas of the software|
|regression-averse test strategy|A test strategy whereby the test team applies various techniques to manage the risk of regression such as functional and/or non-functional regression test automation at one or more levels|
|back-to-back testing|Testing to compare two or more variants of a test item or a simulation model of the same test item by executing the same test cases on all variants and comparing the results|
|UI/ GUI testing|Testing performed by interacting with the software under test via the graphical user interface|
|Black box test technique|A test technique based on an analysis of the specification of a component or system, tester does not care about the internal code, but the expected output by the given input|
|Grey box testing| a combination of white-box testing and black-box testing, The aim of this testing is to search for the defects if any due to improper structure or improper usage of applications|
|White/ clear box testing|The opposit of Black box, The tester chooses inputs to exercise paths through the code and determine the expected outputs|
